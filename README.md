This is a 2D platformer made in Unity called "Woodsedge". Just download and open in Unity. Go to the title scene which sould be in the Scenes folder and press the play button to run the game.
You could also run any scene you wish, the game is partitioned in a way that all the appropriate variables are set at the start of each scene so it won't cause problems.

Controls:

Move: arrows/wasd
Jump: spacebar
Sword/fire attack: left control
Pause: p

You can jump on the wolves to kill them but not the archers.
Haven't enabled purchasing at the shop, probably won't because this is just a demo.

There aren't any bugs that I know of in this demo. It's just a fun short level displaying some game mechanics and nice artwork (I didn't do the artwork, but I did choose them).
